it appears to have EPS, and a smart enough EPS to do parallel park assist... I wouldn't call that confirmed, but it's a good omen 
aww yeah look at those login codes on that carsystems link... lane assist is in the cards
can't really confirm without verifying your EPS P/N with an Auto-Scan, but I'm liking it

Passat B6 (2005 -) and B7 ( - 2015) (EU) are PQ46


@carlos_ddd My Passat is a B6 with factory ACC. I have coded Lane Assist in the steering rack. The EON display does not show any speed,  always stays on 0 and MAX N/A is static. The ACC stalk does not change anything on the EON.


We need a cabana log of your drive. Although B6 is PQ it is vastly different from B7 since ACC and lane assist are on powertrain CAN. There simply is no extended CAN as on B7

@dkiiv He means stock car from 2010. Anyways probably a 2005 VW with few retrofits can run OP too... Maybe even earlier, dont really know when PQ35/46 started. VW has a lot of potential! ðŸ˜‰
